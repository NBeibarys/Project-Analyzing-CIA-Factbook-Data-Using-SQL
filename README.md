# World Factbook Data Analysis
This project explores global socioeconomic and demographic indicators using the CIA World Factbook dataset. The goal is to extract meaningful insights about population, geography, and other indicators across countries, while also practicing SQL-driven analysis. 

## Project Structure
- `Project.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook with SQL code.
- `factbook.db` - SQLite database containing World Factbook data (population, GDP, area, resources, etc.).

## Key Insights
- Inspected outliers (e.g., World, Antarctica) using SQL and built a clean dataset, ensuring accurate and unbiased population analysis.
- Analyzed population growth trends with SQL aggregations to pinpoint regions facing rapid demographic pressure, supporting policy and planning insights.
- Calculated and compared population densities across 200+ countries, revealing striking global contrasts and highlighting high-risk, high-density regions.
- Identified nations with natural population decline by contrasting death and birth rates, interpreting results with unit-aware rigor to avoid misrepresentations.
